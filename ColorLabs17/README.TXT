USER INSTRUCTIONS:

1) Jayanti - She said the salmon color was too bright and I needed a more contrast color. It was also hard to see the face and my teeth looked a little weird. The hair and dress also matched, so she said to try and change the color.
2) My mom - She said that the color was good and it was easier to see our faces. The dress and hair had a clear contrast and it looked much better.
